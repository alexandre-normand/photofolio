Probably because the majestic scenes are so difficult to capture well in a single picture. It's much easier to reduce the scope of your ambitions and focus on something more manageable. But that's only one reason. There are a lot of ordinary scenes that go underappreciated because they happen everywhere or happen all the time. But they're still pretty fantastic and beautiful if we just take time to stop and look." for-sale="true" %}}
