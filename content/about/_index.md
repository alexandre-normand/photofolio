My story, like everyone else's, constantly rewrites itself. Today, I'd say that I grew up and lived most of my life in beautiful Qu√©bec but with a conventional modern lifestyle. My family and I moved in 2012 to the west coast of the United States and, like all major life events, I found myself transformed by the experience. I'm still to this day discovering the world more than I've ever before and discovering myself in the process. 

This portfolio reflects one of this most recent attempts at learning about myself and the world. I'm on a hiatus from my software engineering work and I'd like to see if I can focus on more creative work and maybe earn a little money from it. This means checking if my photography has an audience that it speaks to and if that audicence attributes it some value. 

If you see something that you like even if you don't have the money to spend on art, I'd love to hear from you. Just [write me](mailto:alexandre.normand@gmail.com).
