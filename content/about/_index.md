My story, like everyone else's, constantly rewrites itself. I grew up and lived most of my life in beautiful Qu√©bec. I've always been attracted to creative work (drawing, writing, even scuplting?) but didn't think I had it in me. With the pressure of school and modernity, I went into software engineering. I found it pretty easy (and natural?) while getting that sense of creativity (not always but sometimes). I was happy doing this for a while until I grew annoyed enough that my work wasn't contributing to anything meaningful and then I searched for some work that would provide that meaning. So in 2012, my family and I moved to California so I could work for Opower to reduce energy consumption and save the world.
